    "I began my professional career as a web-content writer, and it was as a writer that I gained my first exposure to HTML, CSS and web-development processes. In the last couple of years, I have changed my focus to front-end development and am constanlty teaching myself more about the field while gaining on-the-job experience."

      "anchor": "Personal Budget Application",
      "explanation": "I'm creating a Personal Budget Application using AngularJS, CSS, JavaScript and HTML. All of the free budget applications that I've found online are based on spreadsheets, and I hate using spreadsheets. So, I'm building my own. Currently, you're only able to add, edit, delete and print budget information. There is no backend support or user states; that's further down the road. I'm going to keep developing this application, so stay tuned."

      "explanation": "This page was redesigned to provide all of the available checklists in one place. Originally, the user had to navigate several pages and a sign-in form to access a single checklist, and they had to sign in for each checklist. Now, a single click will load the checklist in the iframe space indicated; the images, links, content and iframes are loaded dynamically with JavaScript. Third-party cookies are required to view the checklists in the iframe, so a check is included to verify that the user has third-party cookies enabled."

      "explanation": "My last project at Coleman was to create several pages to highlight the various technologies the company had invented. I was given a free hand with the design and layout. The content came from the various catalogs and images were found in the database. I’m pleased with the resulting “tech center”. However, I was limited to inline JavaScript and styling, so there are no shared components between the pages (the left nav should be a common component). I hope, in the future, they are able to turn this into a template-driven section of the site."

      "explanation": "This is the main project I worked on at Janus. I worked collaboratively with the Marketing, Dev and Design teams, as well as other contractors, to bring this site to completion. Aside from helping to build the pages/site, one major contribution I had was providing feedback when the original designs and content weren't laid out properly or optimized for the web."

      "anchor": "Select Janus Institutional Pages",
      "explanation": "The Institutional arm of Janus wanted some of their pages completely redesigned and a few new funds added. Unfortunately, the Institutional site is on an older technology stack and CMS and is difficult to manage; new designs are next to impossible without a significant time commitment from the developer team. So, the digital marketing manager looked to me to solve this problem. Using a lot of jQuery and cowboy-style coding (but very minimal inline styling), I was able to provide the pages the Institutional business was looking for while maintaining the look and feel of the actual Institutional site. The above linked page along with the 'Investment Insights', 'Defined Contribution' and 'About Us' pages in the main navigation bar utilize my custom styles while the other buttons take you to the standard Institutional site."

      "explanation": "I built this page for Janus Capital Group at the beginning of 2015. I was given an Axure file design and was able to lay the page out and implement all of the functionality they desired. Since I did not have access to upload custom styles for the bubbles, I had to use jQuery and a little in-line styling to achieve the colors and hover functionality. The small bubbles at the bottom of the page also feature jQuery tooltips that open on hover. The jQuery UI widgets were available within the Janus CMS, so I could build those pieces without in-line styling."

      "anchor": "Essential Estate Planning Documents",
      "explanation": "One of the tasks I was given while Janus re-platformed their Retail website was to add jQuery togglers to several articles. The widget was available within the CMS, so I was able to customize the properties to achieve the desired functionality. Due to the nature of the Ingeniux Content Management System, I had to create several common components (<div> tags) in the system so they can be reused wherever togglers are required."

      "anchor": "Converting Your Traditional IRA",
      "explanation": "Another project I took on at Janus was to create common components and an easy method to assign links to the right rail zone on all article pages. I achieved this using taxonomy and special component schemas called 'Annotations'. Rather than hard-coding right-rail links on the necessary pages, there is now a repository of links with associated taxonomy categories from which to choose. Given the opportunity, there are further improvements I would make to the right-rail creation and link assignment method."

      "explanation": "The Java language and Grails framework are used by Janus to dynamically generate data tables throughout the site, primarily on the fund pages. I was able to repurpose the code for one of those tables to create this page. Since Janus content has an expiration date, whenver one of the documents on this table expires, the row will disappear until the content is refreshed and the expiration date changed."
