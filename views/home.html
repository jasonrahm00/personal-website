<h1>About Jason Rahm</h1>
<img alt="Jason Rahm Headshot" class="profile-picture" src="images/jason-rahm.jpg">
<p>My name is Jason Rahm and this is my custom-built website. I am a skilled online writer and content manager, aspiring front-end web developer and seasoned start-up professional. On this site you'll find a portfolio of my recent work as well as an updated(ish) copy of my resume. I am looking for an interesting and challenging opportunity to utilize my existing content skillset while expanding my knowledge and experience in web development. I like to stay busy when I'm on the job, so if there are no tasks currently on my plate, I'll find something to do.</p>
<p>When I'm not working or improving this website, you may see me out running around Denver or on the mountain trails. I also play online video games in my free time; World of Warcraft is my current poison of choice. When I need a break from the computer screen, I read or write.</p>
