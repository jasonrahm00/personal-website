# Personal Website
This repository contains the code for my personal website. The site is basically a prettier version of my resume but it's the first thing I look to update whenever I learn anything new about web development.
## Hosted URL
[Personal Website](https://jasonrahm.com/)
## Tech Used
- ReactJS
- Redux
- MaterialUI
- Google Cloud Firestore (database and hosting)
## Roadmap
- Build an API endpoint to serve the content (it's currently being pulled directly from the database through React packages)
- Possibly replace Redux and use React's built-in context to pass data between components
- Add functionality to edit content directly on the site (my own rudimentary CMS), as opposed to through the Firebase interface
